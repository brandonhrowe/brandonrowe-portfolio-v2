        <p>
          I am a Fullstack Software Engineer, located in Brooklyn, NY. I
          specialize in JavaScript and the NERD stack (Node, Express, React,
          Postgres Databases), with additional experience in Python and Django.
          <br />
          <br />I have several years of experience in the world of
          Film/Television Post-Production, working with clients such as HBO,
          Netflix, and IFC. In addition to programming, my interests include
          film, reading, and photography. I also teach workshops in analog film
          processing.
